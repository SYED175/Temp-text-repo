Docker:
Its an platform for running, shipping applications, 
It packages the application with all its dependencies together in form of a container.

Understanding docker:
DockerFile: Text document containing the commands to assemble image.
DockerImage: Template to create a image.. (created using docker file).


------------------

commands:

*check version
docker -v

*pull image
docker pull hello-world
docker pull openjdk

*show images
docker images


docker ps -a
list of continers which were created


*run with flag - 
docker run -e

docker run --name pythonContainer  -d 3af3rfedd(imageID)
1342r3eedcfldja281818

docker ps
list of containers which are running.


*to keep container up & running.. we need use -it (interactive)
docker run --name pythonContainer1 -it -d python 


*go inside the running container
docker exec -it containerid "command given by container.. by docker ps"

question, download, openjdk from docker hub, create its container up running.

ans:

docker pull openjdk

//check images
docker images


//any container running
docker ps 

//run the image or create a container, up & running
docker run --name javaContainer -it -d openjdk


//use container, go inside
docker exec -it containerId||javaContainer jshell

after this we go inside container

------

docker pull mysql

see the docs its helpful

if the images is a server type which requires a port, then dont need to mention -it to keep it running.



docker login

docker commit, save image
docker push, image will be push from local system


--------------------
create image..
create folder.

open vscode

create file

Dockerfile without extension

FROM ubuntu
MAINTAINER syed
RUN apt update
CMD ['echo','this is ubuntu-image']


docker build -t myimagebuntuimage .

//image is now created
docker run --name ubuntuContainer myimagebuntuimage


-----------------------

create a simple javaprogram
now create a Dockerfile


inside docker file:

#base image is needed
from openjdk:11

WORKDIR usr/src/myapp

COPY . usr/src/myapp/

RUN javac Test.java

 
cmd ["java","Test"]



docker compose

its a high level tool for defining and processing multi-containers

ssh stands for secure shell, cryptographic network protocol use secure communication over computer network.
ssh is commonly used for accessing remote servers, it provides a secure way to login to remote server, key features, encrypting, authentication, file transfer using  SCP

example:
