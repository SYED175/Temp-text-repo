In each round find min value starting from index = 0 & swap it.

round - 1: 64,25,12,22,11 - (swap 64 with min val in array starting from index = 0, ie 11)
round - 2: 11,25,12,22,64 - (swap 25 with min val in array starting from index = 1, ie 12)
round - 3: 11,12,25,22,64 - 
round - 4: 11,12,22,25,64 -

for n elements in array, n-1 rounds


space complexity: O(1)
time complexity: Best & worst case =  O(n2)

use case:
when array size is small, we can try selection sort
