Surah Mutaffifin

When Prophet peace be upon him came to madina.. 
he notice madina people had a habit of give bad measurements.. 
i,e they use to cheat one and other..

Which is mentioned in the second ayah,
Allazina izaktalu alan nasi yastaufun.. 
ie when they use to take from others they would take full measurements,
 and take extra as well.

Then the next ayah says, wa iza kalu hum au wazanuhum yuqsirun... 
but when they give by measure they used to cause loss...(give less than due)

Side story:.. there is more than once where Allah has talked about measurements, like surah Anam, ayah 152.
Wa aoful kila wal mizana bilqisti, la nukalifu nafsan ila wus aha.
"And Give full measure and full weight with justice, We burden not any person, but with which he can bear"

Prophet Shuaib (A.S) was sent to community, called as 'Ashab-al-Aykah' (companions of the woods),
 they were so called b	ecause they used to worship a large tree.
Prophet Shuaib (A.S) warned people to end their fraudulent ways, 
and repent to Allah, but the community didn't pay attention... 
Allah then destroyed the community.
The Druze revere Shuaib as an important figure in their faith, and hold an annual pilgrimage.
